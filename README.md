## The Badlands Challenge

The oceans have boiled away, evaporated by a harsh sun.
The plants and animals have all but died.
You pilfer old mineshafts to sustain your meager existence,
but you can't go on like this forever.
A distant jungle offers hope.

Welcome to **The Badlands Challenge**.

-----

The Badlands Challenge is a new way to play the game using minecraft's Buffet feature.

You spawn in a huge badlands biome that stretches infinitely in the northwest and southeast directions.
To the northeast and southwest, after 9km you'll find a 1km-wide desert,
the barren remains of a once thriving jungle.
At the far edge a sliver of jungle remains.
Beyond that is about 2.3km of a collection of biomes that should be able to provide you with most resources.

No passive mobs or trees spawn in badlands biomes,
so you'll need to collect wood and food from abandoned mines until you reach the jungle.

**Rules**

* No sleeping until you reach the jungle
* Try not to die

**How To Play**

* Create a buffet world in harcore mode
* Exit the game
* Locate the folder for the world you just created
* Use an NBT editor to change `generatorOption` in `level.dat` to [this]().
* Optionally, back up `level.dat` so that you can just copy it to a new save if you die
* Delete all the files under the `region` folder
* Relaunch the game
* Open the world
* Head for (10000, 10000) or (-10000, -10000)

Optionally, once you reach the jungle you can switch your world out of hardcore mode as a reward for completing the challenge.
To do that,

* Exit the game
* Edit `level.dat` like you did before and change `hardcore` to `0`
